<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Carrie and I'm a Web Designer learning Web Development. 
  I'm tired of no-code and want more control of my projects.
</p>
<p>
  In the future, I also hope to learn App Development.
</p>
<p>
  I have some knowledge of programming already from previous attempts to learn, 
  and sometimes use SQL for data analysis projects. I'm excited to level up my 
  skills and take this seriously.
