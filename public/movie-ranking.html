<h1>The Best Movies According to Carrie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Hauntingly beautiful story about a cursed wizard, living flame, and 
    sweet, albeit out-of-place, hatter as fate brings them together
    for a magical adventure to be remembered.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Incredibly artful film about a girl learning personal responsibility, 
    independence, and gratitude as she is spirited away to a different world 
    and her parents are turned into pigs!</p>
<h3>Willy the Sparrow</h3>
<p>A humbling tale about a mischievous boy experiencing life from a smaller, 
    more fragile perspective as a sparrow when a fairy decides to teach him a 
    valuable lesson about kindess.</p>
